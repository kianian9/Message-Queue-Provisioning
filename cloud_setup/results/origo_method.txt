Johan's Origo Method:
    Settings:
        Machine Type:           e2-highcpu-8, e2-highcpu-16
        Cluster Setup:          1, 3, 5
        Brokers:                Kafka, RabbitMQ, STAN
        Producer/Consumer Mode: 1 prod/cons, 3 prod/cons, 5 prod/cons
        Message Setting:        [Originally 100 B, changed to 4000 B], 500 B, 1000 B
    Run each test 3 times for statistically significant data

    – Number of messages (total data to send 7 GB):
        ∗ 7 000 000 000 B / 500 B = 14 000 000 messages
        ∗ 7 000 000 000 B / 1000 B = 7 000 000 messages
        ∗ 7 000 000 000 B / 4000 B = 1 750 000 messages

    Using Origo Method for being able to eliminate future unsignificant tests (total 486 if run all)

    Client in these tests is of machine-type: e2-highcpu-16


    (REMEMBER: Get both resource monitoring data and broker data)
    Method:
        1) Run the so-called "middle" setting above, which is:
            Test 1: 
                    Machine Type:                       e2-highcpu-8
                    Cluster Setup:                      3

                    Producer Mode/Consumer Mode:        3 prod/cons
                    Message Setting:                    500 B

            1.1) After Test 1 is run 3 times for every broker, analyze the results and try to find the setting that seemed to make most
                 difference between brokers depending on throughput and latency metrics

                Analysis:
                    * RabbitMQ:
                        * Does not seem to scale well, does not make any sense to test 5 prod/cons or create 5 node cluster
                        * Very CPU heavy, a run utilize about half of the available CPUs in the cluster

                    * Kafka:
                        * Scales very good, the replication factor and number of partitions (3 in this case), helps reaching high consumer throughput
                        * Has the highest throughput and lowest latency in this test

                    * STAN:
                        * Does not seem to scale so good either (compared to Kafka), but still much better than RabbitMQ

                    * In overall, the message size seems to drop down the throughput quite a lot (compared with 1000B in the testplan)
                    * Should also test with higher machine-type and see how much the performance increases [DONE]



            1.2) Create a new setting with better machine-type and see if it makes difference, and expand tests again
                Test 2:

                    Analysis:
                        * RabbitMQ:
                            * Results became slightly better, but not so significantly
                            * Could possibly increase performance by scaling down or using higher message size

                        * Kafka:
                            * Same as in Test 1 above, scales very good. Could try increase number of prod/cons to 5 and see if performance increase further

                        * STAN:
                            * Results became better but not significantly

                        * In overall slightly better results than in Test 1, the problems with RabbitMQ and STAN still exists:
                            * Results became in overall better for all message systems, but not significantly
                            * Conclusions:
                                1. RabbitMQ and STAN doesn't seem to scale good, possible solution is to both test smaller cluster and lower level of parallelism (1 prod/cons)
                                2. Kafka seem to scale very good, try both a 5 node cluster and 5 prod/cons for 3 node cluster
                                3. Don't run smaller message sizes than 500 B as results became worse than tests done in testplan
                                


            1.3) Test smaller cluster setting to see if RabbitMQ's and STAN's performance increase (only difference from the "middle" setting (Test 1) is number of nodes):

                    Analysis:
                        * In general better results than in Test 1, the performance of RabbitMQ and STAN became better in this test:
                            * Conclusions:
                                * The STAN broker's producer throughput became higher, while the consumer throughput became worse, which leads to higher latencies
                                    * The "leader/master" broker doesn't need to replicate the data which therefore leads to higher publisher throughput
                                    * A possible reason why the consumer throughput is getting worse could that there arise a bottleneck at the broker (due to higher producer throughput than Test 1),
                                      and it does not keep up with delivering messages to consumers
                                * As in STAN, all write/read requests goes through the leader/master in RabbitMQ, and since we don't have any data replication, the latency & throughput gets better compared to Test 1
                                * The results became slightly better for Kafka as well, despite the fact that Test 1 uses 3 number of partitions and 3 broker to replicate the data, the higher level of parallelism does
                                  not lead to higher performance compared to a single node cluster setup with num.partitions & replication factor == 1
                                    * The data replication could potentially lead to lower producer throughput which then also impacts the consumer throughput.
                                * Results became in overall better for all message systems
                                
                            * For improving the performance further, we should test the systems with a 1 prod/cons setup as well... [DONE]

                    Analysis:

                            * More than 200 ms lower latency for the messages in RabbitMQ compared to Test 1 - good implication on that RabbitMQ is not horizontal scalable
                        * Kafka reached its peak for the producer throughput, by comparing Test 1 with Test 4, we can see both are reaching 50 MB/s, and increasing nr of producers doesn't really help


                        * An increase of the message size (to 1000 B) could potentially solve the broker limitations, and better performance can be reached [DONE]

                Analysis:
                    * RabbitMQ increased its performance using 1000 B messages instead of 500 B a lot compared to other 3 broker cluster tests with 3 prod/cons
                    * The consumer throughput for STAN became much better when using this setup, NATS server seems to be more optimized for larger messages than 500 B
                    * The message size did not have any impact on Kafka brokers, maybe try larger scale?

                    * Could test same broker setup with e2-highcpu-16 machine type as well [DONE]
                    * Could also test a 5 node cluster to see if Kafka scales even more? [DONE]

                Analysis:
                    * Compared to Test 2, where we had the same setup but were running with 500 B message size, we can for all brokers see an increase in both producer and consumer throughput

                Analysis:
                    * By using higher level of parallelism and replication factor/number of partitions, the consumer throughput for Kafka became high
                        * A possible answer to why Test 7 didn't perform this well could be too small number of partitions, not benefiting larger levels of parallelism
                    * However, the producer throughput for RabbitMQ and STAN became much less due to consensus overhead

                    * Could test the same settings with higher machine type to see how much more the performance could be increased [DONE]
                    * Could also test the same settings, with the main difference where larger message sizes (1000 B) are used [DONE]
                    * Could also test a single broker setup using this setup to see how much the performance differ [MAYBE NOT NEEDED - SEE RESULTS OF Test 3]
